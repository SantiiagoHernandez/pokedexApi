## How was the application performed?

This Pokedex application was built using a combination of standard web technologies, Pokémon data from the PokeAPI, and design customization. Here's how it was done:

- **HTML5**: HTML5 was used for the basic structure of the page, including defining elements such as headers, images and links.

- **CSS3**: The application was styled and designed using CSS3 to create an attractive and responsive interface. Styling was applied to Pokémon containers, images and other elements to achieve a pleasing look and feel.

- **JavaScript**: was used for the application logic. The PokeAPI was accessed for Pokémon data and Pokémon cards were created dynamically.

- **PokeAPI**: The PokeAPI provided essential data about the Pokémon, including names, numbers, types, and sprites. This data was obtained via HTTP requests and integrated into the application to display detailed information about each Pokémon.

- **Google Fonts**: Google Fonts' "Lato" font was incorporated to improve text stylization in the application.

The app was developed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, allowing users to explore and learn about Pokémon intuitively. This Pokedex is expected to be both informative and entertaining for Pokémon lovers.
