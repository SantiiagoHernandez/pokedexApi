## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How was the application performed?

This Pokedex application was built using a combination of standard web technologies, Pok√©mon data from the PokeAPI, and design customization. Here's how it was done:

- **HTML5**: HTML5 was used for the basic structure of the page, including defining elements such as headers, images and links.

- **CSS3**: The application was styled and designed using CSS3 to create an attractive and responsive interface. Styling was applied to Pok√©mon containers, images and other elements to achieve a pleasing look and feel.

- **JavaScript**: was used for the application logic. The PokeAPI was accessed for Pok√©mon data and Pok√©mon cards were created dynamically.

- **PokeAPI**: The PokeAPI provided essential data about the Pok√©mon, including names, numbers, types, and sprites. This data was obtained via HTTP requests and integrated into the application to display detailed information about each Pok√©mon.

- **Google Fonts**: Google Fonts' "Lato" font was incorporated to improve text stylization in the application.

The app was developed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, allowing users to explore and learn about Pok√©mon intuitively. This Pokedex is expected to be both informative and entertaining for Pok√©mon lovers.
